// The t() miss / pending policy and its release-vs-non-release split.
//
// Locked decision #4: on a miss, t() THROWS for an untracked key in dev/test,
// renders English for a registry-`pending` key on a non-release build only, and
// HARD-FAILS for a pending key on a release build. Release is detected via
// I18N_RELEASE=1 (tests/build) or import.meta.env.PROD (the real Vite build).
//
// These are permanent regression guards with real teeth: the untracked cases run
// against the real table; the pending cases inject a synthetic pending key through
// the generated module so the ACTUAL t() pending branch is exercised in both
// release and non-release modes (the real `pending` set is empty while overlays
// stay dense, so it cannot be triggered from committed data alone).
