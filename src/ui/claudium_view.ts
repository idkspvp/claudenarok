// Pure, host-agnostic view model for the CLAUDIUM window.
//
// The pure-core half of the pure-core + thin-consumer split (root CLAUDE.md
// Conventions; reference vendor_view.ts / stat_tooltip_view.ts). CLAUDIUM is a
// server-authoritative soft currency: the peg, prices, SKU credits, balance, and
// purchase amounts ALL come from the economy service. This core recomputes NONE of
// them; it only projects the service payloads into the render rows and the
// per-rail availability the window paints. DOM-free and i18n-free so
// tests/claudium_view.test.ts can drive it directly.
//
// The one non-negotiable: when the balance is null (the service is off) the model
// is a clean disabled/empty state, NEVER an error crash.
//
// Card is the ONLY rail. This core once modelled three more (SOL, USDC and a
// community token) with wallet balances and per-SKU native quotes; the rails were
// switched off, the server stopped offering them, and the scaffolding sat here
// dead. It is gone rather than pinned to false, because dead scaffolding is what
// let the removal look finished while the surface was still shipping.
